" Manchester Victoria station is opened by the Manchester and Leeds Railway","01/01/1844","The Manchester and Leeds Railway (M&LR) was founded in 1836 and the company began building its line between Manchester and Leeds in 1837.  The M&LR built an extension from Miles Platting  to the station which opened on 1 January 1844. On this date, the Oldham  Road terminus was closed to passenger services and became a goods  station. The new station had a 852 ft (260 m) long single platform which  handled M&LR trains to Leeds and elsewhere at its eastern end. The  L&MR extended its line from Ordsall to Victoria and its trains operated from the western end from 4 May 1844, on which date its Liverpool Road station terminus became a goods station. The station was named Victoria in 1843. Its long, single-storey building designed by George Stephenson and completed by John Brogden was approached by a wooden footbridge over the River Irk before the river was culverted. Most of the original 1844 station buildings are standing including part of the original façade on Hunt's Bank. The L&MR became part of the Grand Junction Railway in 1845, which in turn amalgamated with other railways to create the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1846, and the M&LR amalgamated with other railways to create the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR) the following year. The headquarters of the L&YR were based alongside Victoria.","Manchester","53.487807, -2.241501","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Manchester_Victoria_station_19-10-2009_12-11-47kopie.jpg/530px-Manchester_Victoria_station_19-10-2009_12-11-47kopie.jpg","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Victoria_station"
